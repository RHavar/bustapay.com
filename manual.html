    <h1>Make a manual bustapay transaction</h1>

    <h3>Step 1. Create raw tranasction paying the receiver (but do not broadcast)</h3>
    <p>
        This can be done with any wallet of your choice, but with <strong>bitcoin core</strong>, this would be achieved with:<br><br>
        
                <code>
                        bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction [] "{ \"2NABbUr9yeRCp1oUCtVmgJF8HGRCo3ifpTT\": 1.23 }"
                </code><br>(obviously replacing that address with where you want to send, and that amount in bitcoin of how much you want to send)
        <br><br>

        Then we would need to fund it, this can be done with:<br>
        <code>bitcoin-cli fundrawtransaction HEX_FROM_ABOVE</code><br><br>

        And the finally signing it:<br>
        <code>bitcoin-cli signrawtransactionwithwallet HEX_FROM_ABOVE</code><br>
        (note: in older versions of bitcoin core, it was called "signrawtransaction" instead of "signrawtransactionwithwallet")
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2. Send the raw transaction to the bustapay url</h3>
    <p>
        This can be done with some curl magic (basically http post with a binary (not hex) encoded body).
        But it's probably easier to use our browser-based tool. <br>
        <em>note: this is directly sent to the bustapay url, we never log or see this</em>
        <form>
            bustapay url: <input type="text" id="bustapay-url-input" /><br/>
            hex-encoded raw transaction:  <textarea id="raw-transaction-input"></textarea><br>
            <button type="button" id="submit-bustpay" onclick="sendBustapay()">Send!</button>
        </form>
        <div id="response-div" style="display: none">
               Response: <textarea disabled="disabled" id="response-text"></textarea>                
        </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3. Verify server response</h3>
    <p>
        We need to decode the server response, generally something like <code>bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction HEX_FROM_SERVER</code>
        or if you're in a pinch (not recommended) you can use <a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/decodetx/" target="_blank">a web tool</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The most important thing to check is that all outputs are the same as our original transaction. They may however be shuffled, and some of the amounts maybe have increased
        but they should <strong>never</strong> decrease, nor should any be missing. Next you want to check that all your previous inputs are still in the transaction, but their
        signature should be stripped. And the only new inputs should be signed. In the future this tool will be updated to validate the server response, but it currently isn't done
        so you're on your own here. If there is a problem, or you are not able to do it <strong>do not continue</strong> and just broadcast your original (normal) payment.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4. Sign the partial transaction</h3>
    <p>
        Done in <strong>bitcoin core</strong> with <code>bitcoin-cli signrawtransactionwithwallet PARTIAL_TRANSACTION_IN_HEX</code><br>
        (note: in older versions of bitcoin core, it was called "signrawtransaction" instead of "signrawtransactionwithwallet")        
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5. Broadcast the final signed transaction</h3>
    <p>
        In <strong>bitcoin core</strong> you could do that with: <code>bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction FINAL_TRANSACTION_IN_HEX</code> or use
        or if you're in a pinch (not recommended) you can use a <a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/pushtx/" target="_blank">web-based tool</a>
        although this is not recommended unless you use tor, as they almost certainly will be logging your broadcast.
